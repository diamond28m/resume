    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As a graduate of the university, with a very good degree in Computer Engineering. I held several
        internships within leading organizations. These internships enabled me to gain experience in the field
        and learn how to serve up valuable contributions in a fast-paced, professional environment. I also have
        the resourcefulness needed to overcome difficult challenges as and when they occur without the need
        to constantly seek advice from my manager or supervisor.</p>
